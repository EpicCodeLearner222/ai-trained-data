  "Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible! Honey's natural composition, including its low moisture content and acidic pH, makes it resistant to bacteria and spoilage.",
  "If you're curious about more facts or a specific topic, just let me know!",
  "One of the most interesting facts is that octopuses have three hearts! Two of the hearts pump blood to the gills, where it picks up oxygen, while the third heart pumps the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. Interestingly, when an octopus swims, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer crawling to swimming—it's less tiring for them!",
  "If you want to learn more fascinating facts or delve into a specific subject, just let me know!",
  "Here’s a fun piece of trivia: Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren't! Botanically speaking, a berry is a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower with seeds embedded in the flesh. Since bananas fit this definition, they are classified as berries, while strawberries, which develop from a flower with multiple ovaries, do not qualify as true berries.",

  "Here’s a weird but true fact: Honey never spoils! Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Honey's long shelf life is due to its low moisture content and acidic pH, which create an inhospitable environment for bacteria and microorganisms.",
  "Octopuses have three hearts. Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. When they swim, the heart that delivers blood to the body actually stops beating!",
  "Dolphins have names for each other. They use unique whistles to identify and call each other, much like humans use names.",
